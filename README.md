# My dotfiles

## TL;DR

### Requirements

have brew installed on MacOS (linux support for the install part is not done yet)

### Installing

the aim is to make things work quickly and avoid the hassle of setting things up manually.

Run:

```
./install.sh
```

This should download and setup most of the tools needed to run this configs.
It should also link everything dotfiles in place so that your system picks them up directly.

NOTE: when oh-my-zsh install, it launch itself, just `C-d` your way out of it and the script will continue.

you may also need to run the install twice (I don't have the energy to check out why at the moment).

## The setup in a nutshell

I've started using vim and tmux fairly recently (mar-2018) so this is still pretty raw.
This setup uses nvim, tmux and kitty (mostly to get a consistent font-liggature support no matter which OS you're running).
I am fairly happy with the state of it, but I'm sure it's gonna keep changing.
