# Setup

The only thing needed for now is to install [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) beforehand:

```
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Optionally:

- install a NERD font to get the proper icon all around vim.
- install [livedown](https://github.com/shime/livedown) via ```npm i -g livedown```
- install neovim bindings for python ```pip3 install neovim```
